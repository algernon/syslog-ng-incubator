Package: syslog-ng-mod-trigger
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Enhanced system logging daemon (trigger source)
 syslog-ng is an enhanced log daemon, supporting a wide range of input
 and output methods: syslog, unstructured text, message queues,
 databases (SQL and NoSQL alike) and more.
 .
 Key features:
 .
  * receive and send RFC3164 and RFC5424 style syslog messages
  * work with any kind of unstructured data
  * receive and send JSON formatted messages
  * classify and structure logs with builtin parsers (csv-parser(),
    db-parser(), etc.)
  * normalize, crunch and process logs as they flow through the system
  * hand on messages for further processing using message queues (like
    AMQP), files or databases (like PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
 .
 This package provides the trigger() source, which is most useful as a
 debugging aid.
